**Sumjo** is an image recognition application that uses AI to calculate the outcome of a SKYJO (c) game by analyzing a photo taken at the end of the game.

SKYJO, a card game developed by Magilano and suitable for players aged 7 to 99, is an engaging and entertaining experience. The goal is to maintain the lowest score possible across multiple rounds. Scores are carefully tracked and summed up after each round, with the game ending when any player exceeds 100 points. The player with the lowest total score at this point is declared the winner.

## Install

~~The application can be installed via the Google Play Store or Mac App Store on mobile device.~~ --> **Soon**

Please note that it is currently in beta testing phase and not publicly available. To request an invitation to try out Sumjo, send me a message. I will add you to the preview list, allowing you to find Sumjo in Google Play store.

Alternatively you can build the app yourself, see [‚¨áÔ∏è Use from sources](#use-from-sources) or [releases page](https://github.com/tib0/sumjo/releases) install APK according to the following [how to](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-APK-Files-on-Android).

## How it works

### App usage

At the end of a Skyjo game run the app and take a picture of your board state by touching the button, then the result will appear on the screen.

### Internally

I used models and training data samples available here https://universe.roboflow.com/elmurd0r/skyjo to train a TFLite model with Yolo https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5. I used Expo (https://expo.dev/) to power the app with code written in React Native. The model itself runs with https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-fast-tflite which relies on TensorFlow Lite library and exposes it to my react components. To handle camera, I use https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera. The picture is then cropped and resized using Skia https://github.com/shopify/react-native-skia.

### Device compatibility

- Needs camera
- iOS / Android
