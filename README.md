**Sumjo** is an image recognition application that let you get your results on Skyjo (c) end game board.

SKYJO (Copyright by Magilano) is an entertaining card game for 7-99.
In this captivating game, the aim is to keep point aggregation to a bare minimum across multiple rounds. At the conclusion of each round, the scores are meticulously recorded and aggregated into each player's overall sum. The instant any player surpasses 100 points or more, the game terminates, and the player who has managed to retain the fewest points shall be proclaimed the triumphant victor.

## How it works

### App usage

At the end of a Skyjo game run the app take a picture of your board state by touching the button, then the result will appear on the screen.

### Internally

I used models and training data sample available here https://universe.roboflow.com/elmurd0r/skyjo to train a TFLite model with Yolo https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5. I used Expo (https://expo.dev/) to power the app with code written in React Native. The model itself run with https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-fast-tflite wich rely on TensorFlow Lite library and expose it to my react components. To handle camera I use https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera. The picture is then cropped and resized using Skia https://github.com/shopify/react-native-skia.
